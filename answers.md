I am a barista turned web developer. I have degree in fine arts with a concentration in creative photography. I have always had a fascinations with visual aesthetics.

I have always held jobs where customer service was highly utilized. Putting others first just speaks to my nature. I am night owl thats probably why I like coffee so much.

Before DBC I was working temporary jobs. Searching for the job that would  constantly challenge me and push me to my limits. My wife's cousin Catie was going through DBC Chicago. Because Catie was onsite, I had a  conversation with her husband, who was a front end developer. After speaking with him I decided to apply.

I choose to enter the tech industry because I have always had a passion that I never realized. Coding is a like a roadmap.It depends on the origin and the destination. There may be multiple way to get to a place or there may be one. One route may be quicker while the other more scenic. Different factors determine the choice of route. I like code because it mixes both the conceptual and factual together.

I am passionate about helping others and making beautiful and meaningful things.

My name is Jordan. I am always interested in learning new things, pushing my limits in order to grow. I love the process of collaboration and working with others. I love being able to support my team. Never underestimate what I am capable of!!!

I have two daughters.  I have worked with photography in  both educational and retail venues.

Within less than a year  from when I started I went from being a salesperson to an assistant manager and rookie of the year at Oceanside Photo and Telescope. I have been awarded partner of the quarter at Starbucks. I finished 1st two semesters in a row, for the swim to Catalina contest. at CSU Fullerton Student Rec Center. Both times in just around a week.
