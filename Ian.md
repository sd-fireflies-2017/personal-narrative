# Question 1
Where are you from? What do you know/do? (Example: previous jobs, fun skills/your superpowers, what you do in your free time, educational background, etc) (i.e., skateboarding, baking a mean apple pie, astronomy nerd, etc.)

# Your Answer:


I've watched attack ships fire off the shoulders of Orion and C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate; the near future where corporation networks reach out to the stars and electrons and light flow throughout the universe.

I grew up climbing trees, wading creeks and getting lost in the woods. When I couldn't be exploring outside, I was devouring alien landscapes and exploring fantastic worlds written in tiny cartridges or etched with lasers onto optical disks.

Always travelling.


# Question 2
What about your career journey is different from your peers? What separates you from other developers? Cull the things that make you YOU and help you stand out from your peers (“I do my best work from 6 a.m.-8 a.m. before anyone gets to the office.” “Acknowledging others is important to me, so I like to type personal thank-you messages to team members and colleagues on the typewriter I was given on my 16th birthday.”)

# Your Answer:



I like to occasionally step back and check in with everyone to make sure things are groovy. I try to make sure people are all on the same page in terms of how the end user with use software. Also prone to stop working occasionally and try to reinforce the overall why's and who's.

 
# Question 3
What were you doing before DBC? What/who impacted your decision to come to DBC?

# Your Answer:


Before I came to DBC, I was organizing and moving goods and people across the country. At least that's what I was trying to do. I felt very limited in things I could impact at the job I was working. The turning point that made me decide to jump into coding was when we began to implement a technology at my workplace. It was counterintuitive, and inefficient. When I wasn't explaining how to use it to others, I was thinking of ways it could be improved.

I have a good friend from when I was younger and we both drew comics and wrote stories and played games together, he has since gone on to become a developer and always hinted that it would be something I would enjoy. He dropped me a hint about DBC and mentioned some of his coworkers were graduates. It let me begin thinking that doing something similar was not outside the realm of possibility even though I did not have the formal education.

 
# Question 4
Why did you choose to enter the tech industry? How do you look at code & what do you like about it?

# Your Answer:


I've always been fascinated with technology and the connections it allows. I remember being blown away the first time I got online and started communicating with people from all over the world.

Before I got more comfortable with code I thought of it as some kind of mystical language that defined building blocks of this kind-of alternate realm that sat on top of and wove itself within the world we inhabit. The more I code, I feel that this is true in a lot of ways. It's an interesting tool built through dialog between ideas and the machine you work on.

 
# Question 5
Describe who you are in terms of the mission/purpose/impact you'd like to have (i.e. teaching kids to code, making learning easier, increasing diversity in tech, etc) 
Or,
What are you passionate about? What gets you geeking out? What could you talk about for hours on end?

# Your Answer:


Id like to increase awareness of how technology can help people and make lives better. Educating and empowering people to use software to enhance their lives, through accessibility or trying to figure out why people click here or there or think this button should do this or that is something I think about often. Human/machine interaction.

 
# Question 6
Write down what you would say to someone at a networking event if they asked, "tell me about yourself?"

# Your Answer:


I want to change the way people interact with technology. I'd like to contribute to challenging established norms with how people use the internet and communicate. I'm interested in input devices and user experiences, particularly in virtual environments or how they can be overlayed into our physical space.


# Question 7
What are some interesting facts about you that are quantifiable? (“I ran five marathons in five different countries; I speak three languages and travel to five continents every year; I worked in six different areas of the business before becoming the head of sales.”)

# Your Answer:


I've been to 48 states and had a whirlwind tour through some of Europe. I've worked for roughly 6 years in customer service related fields and 5 years in logistics getting people things they need.



# Question 8
What kind of external validation have you received?  Include testimonials from others while showcasing all the awards and accolades bestowed upon you (for example, graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Michigan, was named top 30 under 30 by the Chicago Chamber of Commerce).

# Your Answer:


I was the fourth grade spelling champion and first chair saxophonist in my high school jazz band. I was selected to spearhead some new educational policies at my logistics company, and my mother says that I'm handsome.
