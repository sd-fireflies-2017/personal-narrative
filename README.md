# Personal Narrative

We are going to use Github's Pull Request System to get feedback from everyone on your personal narrative.

# Instructions

Create a new branch to hold your narrative. For simplicity, use `first_name-last_name` as the branch naming format. Create your narraive in a file called `narrative.md`. When you are ready commit and push to your branch. Open a new Pull Request and invite your cohort to review.

Remember, all feedback should be Actionable, Specific, and Kind (ASK).

After everyone has provided feedback on your narrative, integrate what you feel is helpful and iterate on your narrative. Ask for feedback as often as you like and continue to iterate until you are satisfied with the results.
