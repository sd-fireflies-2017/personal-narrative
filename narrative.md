Barista turned Web Developer, with a background in creative photography. The process of crafting code is what fuels my desire to constantly learn and develop my knowledge. I have taken my expertise from several years of customer service and have applied it to my personel style of design. When I create a program, a photograph, a cup of coffee, I want the person experiencing it to come away with a change in perspective. I pour my heart and soul into everything that I do. I find joy in the collaborative acheivements of a team.
