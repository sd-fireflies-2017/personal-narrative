One of the best feelings for me was turning my one hour excel task into a five second automation using my beginner knowledge of Python. I was hooked. After studying accounting at San Diego State University and working as a staff accountant for a year I had finally discovered where my abilities would be put to the best use and I devoted my evenings to learning more of my newfound passion. For several months, I spent my evenings teaching myself the basics. I then enrolled in a full stack web development program, DevBootcamp, where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and developed a mobile application using angularJS and ionic. Graduation was in March and I have been pursuing a deeper knowledge of programming, the web, and algorithms since. Outside of coding, I enjoy writing and recording music, reading, and discovering new creative outlets.
