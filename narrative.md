A core value that I’ve integrated into my career is the notion of *kaizen*, or “continuous improvement.” As a former project manager, my primary role was to interface with clients throughout the web development life cycle, and coordinate their needs across multiple departments with a high degree of organization for on-time deliveries. After communicating in-depth with development teams, I was inspired to pursue a more thorough understanding of web development and bridge the gap between the client side and the development side. My path has lead me to come full circle as a web developer, and I enjoy the ability to take ideas and code them into meaningful solutions. In the ever-changing tech industry, my focus to leverage my project management background to be a versatile team player with a strong background on client-facing interaction.
