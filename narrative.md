A Squishy Robot: Self-contained, self-propelled, often amusing, increasingly useful.

My introduction to computer programming was something of a fluke - I first attempted it with a cast around my leg and a bottle of Percocet on the nightstand.  By the time I was once again motivating under my own steam I'd taken enough of an interest in the craft to purse it seriously in spite of my inexperience.  Coming from an academic background in Philosophy I found in the world of software development a similar predilection for analysis and the creation of highly accurate representations of real world objects and systems, but with the added bonus of 'usefulness'.  

Shortly thereafter I began a serious study of full-stack software development, focusing on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript and have taken several projects to deployment in both solo and team settings.

Beyond web development, I'm cultivating interests in low-level languages and algorithms, as well as data science and analytics.  I'm also fond of cats and musical instruments.
