The best feeling is turning your one hour excel task into a 5 second automation. This is what got me hooked into the world of programming. After studying accounting at San Diego State University and working as a staff accountant for a year I had finally discovered where my abilities would be put to the best use and I devoted my evenings to learning the vast world of programming. After some months of self teaching I enrolled in a full stack web development course where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, as well as developing a phone application using angular and ionic in a team setting. I graduated in March and have been pursuing a deeper knowledge of programming, the web, and algorithms. Outside of coding, I enjoy writing and recording music, reading, and learning new skills that will help me create new things.
