I studied behavioral neuroscience at University of San Diego and graduated last spring.  Learning about the mind naturally led to my fascination with computers.  By summer I was totally enthralled in coding, and taught myself a bit of front end development before enrolling in a full stack web development program in the fall.  There I gained a lot of experience working with Ruby on Rails, different javascript libraries and frameworks, as well as Swift for iOS development.  I graduated this March, and now spend most of time working on projects to solidify and expand my programming knowledge.  Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, redditing, the ‘ubuntu’ font, stand-up comedy and gelato.


-David McLaughlin Notes:
Maybe switch first and second sentences. 
Explain the connection of how learning about the mind led to your fascination of computers a little more. I haven't learned much about the mind so the connection isn't as obvious to me.
Your personal notes at the end are good. Putting the 'ubuntu' font is a nice little quirk that isn't too generic or unrelatable. It made me google the ubuntu font.

Overall, it's a very good 'get to know me' paragraph.

-Brendan:

I agree that the natural connection to computers may not be as obvious to some.  Related note - do you know of the book Godel Escher Bach?  May be of interest to you re: consciousness and computers/
Good introduction to your experience and interests overall.
Minor style point -> "There I gained a lot of experience working." I'd refactor this to "I gained experience working".  'a lot' is a bit of a throwaway, and 'there' is implied by the positioning of the sentence.
