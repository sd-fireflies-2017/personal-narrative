I studied accounting at San Diego State University and graduated in 2015. After a year of working as a staff accountant I concluded there must be a better way to complete some of my work. I learned python and wrote some scripts to turn my one hour excel task into a 15 second automation. From that moment I was hooked and devoted my evenings to learning the vast world of programming. After some months of self teaching I enrolled in a full stack web development course where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, as well as developing a phone application using angular and ionic in a team setting. I graduated in March and have been pursuing a deeper knowledge of programming, the web, and algorithms. Outside of coding, I enjoy writing and recording music, reading, and learning any new skill whenever I can.
