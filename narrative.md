I studied behavioral neuroscience at University of San Diego and graduated last spring.  Learning about the mind naturally led to my fascination with computers.  By summer I was totally enthralled in coding, and taught myself a bit of front end development before enrolling in a full stack web development program in the fall.  There I gained a lot of experience working with Ruby on Rails, different javascript libraries and frameworks, as well as Swift for iOS development.  I graduated this March, and now spend most of time working on projects to solidify and expand my programming knowledge.  Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, redditing, the ‘ubuntu’ font, stand-up comedy and gelato.
