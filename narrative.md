The best feeling is turning your one hour excel task into a 5 second automation. This is what got me hooked into the world of programming. After studying accounting at San Diego State University and working as a staff accountant for a year I had finally discovered where my abilities would be put to the best use and I devoted my evenings to learning the vast world of programming. After some months of self teaching I enrolled in a full stack web development course where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, as well as developing a phone application using angular and ionic in a team setting. I graduated in March and have been pursuing a deeper knowledge of programming, the web, and algorithms. Outside of coding, I enjoy writing and recording music, reading, and learning new skills that will help me create new things.

The most gratifying thing Iâ€™ve ever done was turn an hour-long Excel task into a 5 second automation via code. I was hooked. I worked as a staff accountant for a year before I was exposed to the vast world of programming. For several months, I spent my evenings teaching myself the basics. I then enrolled in a full stack web development course where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and developed a mobile application using angularJS and ionic. I graduated in March and have been pursuing a deeper understanding of programing, the interwebs and those elusive algorithms. Beyond coding, I enjoy reading, writing, recording music and learning new creative outlets.
