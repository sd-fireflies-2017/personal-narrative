One of the best feelings was turning my one hour excel task into a five-second automation using my self-taught knowledge of Python. I was hooked. After studying accounting at San Diego State University and working as a staff accountant for a year, I had finally discovered where my abilities would be put to best use and I devoted my evenings to diving into programming. This became my newfound passion, but I wanted to push myself further, so I enrolled in an accelerated, full-stack web development program, DevBootcamp, where I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and developed a mobile application using angularJS and ionic. Graduation was in March and I have been pursuing a deeper knowledge of programming, the web, and algorithms since. Outside of coding, I enjoy writing and recording music, reading, and discovering new creative outlets.
